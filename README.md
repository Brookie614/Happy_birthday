# Happy_birthday
Special Birthday Surprise
Hello Amazing!

Welcome to a little digital adventure I've crafted just for you. In this repository, you'll find a simple but heartfelt Python script - a message decoder designed to unravel a secret just for you. It's a small token to celebrate your special day and to remind you how incredible you are.

How It Works
This script is a playful message decoder. There's a hidden message waiting for you, encoded behind a special key. The key to unlocking this secret? Think of a date. But not just any date - a date that holds a special place in our hearts. It's a moment in time that's as unique as you are.

Instructions
Download the message_decoder.py file.
Run it in your favorite Python environment.
When prompted, enter the key. Remember, it's a date that means the world to us.
A Hint?
If you're in need of a little nudge, think back to a day that marked the beginning of a beautiful journey. It's a date that we both hold dear, a celebration of when things started to become extraordinary.

Note from the Heart
This is more than just a simple coding exercise. It's a reminder of the beautiful moments we've shared and the many adventures yet to come. You're not just amazing at what you do; you're an incredible person, and I'm so grateful for every day with you.

Your presence in my life makes every day brighter, and I hope this little creation brings a smile to your face. Happy Birthday, my love!
